# MongoQueue
Wrote a Python MongoQueue class that connected to the database that picked up jobs from different  collections as different workers , filtered based on priority as well as by checking if the ‘nextRunAt’ field was earlier than the current time and registered each of them with a function call to execute.  After executing each job with some functon, based on the frequency of the job the nextRun was reser accordingly.
