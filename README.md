# MongoQueue
Python MongoQueue class that connects to the database that picks up jobs from different  collections as different workers , filtered based on priority as well as by checking if the ‘nextRunAt’ field was earlier than the current time and registers each of them with a function call to execute.  After executing each job with some functon, based on the frequency of the job the nextRun resets accordingly.
